## 📱 Autonomous Trading Agents on Solana

PawPad is a mobile application built on Flutter that enables users to create autonomous trading agents on the Solana blockchain. These AI-powered agents can perform trades automatically based on market signals, custom strategies, and predictive models.

**🏆 Hackathon Submission for [Solana Breakthrough 2025_by_colosseum]**

## ✨ Features

* **🤖 Autonomous Trading Agents:** Create personalized trading agents that operate 24/7
* **👛 Automated Wallet Creation:** Secure Solana wallet generated for each agent
* **📊 Smart Trading Decisions:** AI-powered market analysis for buy/hold signals
* **⚙️ Custom Trading Strategies:** Select specific coins and timeframes for your agent to trade
* **🔄 Cross-Chain Swaps:** Exchange SOL for tokens across multiple chains
* **📈 Portfolio Management:** Monitor your agent's performance and holdings
* **🛡️ Trading Limits:** Set daily limits to control your agent's trading activity
* **🔬 Strategy Adaptation:** Update trading parameters based on market conditions

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter, Dart
* **Blockchain:** Solana
* **Smart Contracts:** Rust
* **Wallet Management:** Ed25519 Key Pairs
* **API Integration:** Jupiter Swap API
* **AI Predictions:** Custom prediction models
* **Data Storage:** Flutter Secure Storage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Flutter 3.16.0 or higher
* Dart SDK 3.0.0 or higher
* Android Studio / VS Code
* Solana CLI tools (optional)

### Installation

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ZkAGI/PawPad.git
cd pawpad
```

Install dependencies
```
flutter pub get
```

Run the app in development mode

```
flutter run
``` 

Building for Release

# Generate APK
```
flutter build apk --release
```

# Generate AAB for Google Play
```
flutter build appbundle
```

### 🌊 How It Works

- **Agent Creation**: Users create a trading agent with their preferred strategy
- **Secure Wallet**: Each agent gets a dedicated Solana wallet with a secure mnemonic
- **Signal Processing**: Agents check for trading signals at specific intervals:

  - Bitcoin Buy & Hold - Once daily at 3 PM IST
  - Autonomous Trading - Every 12 hours
  - Custom Strategies - Every 8 hours


- **Intelligent Trading**: When buying signals are detected, agents use Jupiter Swap API to execute trades
- **Portfolio Tracking**: All transactions are recorded and tracked for performance analysis

### 🧠 AI Integration
The application uses multiple predictive models to generate trading signals:

Bitcoin Buy & Hold: Daily predictions based on market trends

Autonomous Trading: Pattern recognition for emerging opportunities

Custom Strategy: Specialized models for selected tokens and timeframes

### 🔭 Future Roadmap

- Launchpad where only Autonomous Agents can Participate 
- More operations like Autonomous Liquidity Provisioning on Meteora or similar; onboarding specific DefAI projects to connect with PawPad Wallets 
- Release App on Play store and App Store.
— And Importantly, specific version for Saga Phone users.
